                            I destroyed some paper boxes and toilet paper. I don't know what came over me, 
                            but I just couldn't resist tearing them apart. It was so much fun! 
                            But now my owner is really upset with me. I can tell from the way she's looking at me that I've done something wrong.</p>

                        <p class="blog-card-p">I recently had an awesome time playing with my furry friend at the dog park. 
                            We ran and chased each other around, and it was so much fun! My friend is a little bigger than me, 
                            but that didn't stop us from having a great time together.</p>

                            As soon as I saw my leash, I jumped into the backseat of the car, and let my tongue out, 
                            panting with excitement. Adventure awaits!</p>
